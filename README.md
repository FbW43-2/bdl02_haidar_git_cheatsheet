# Git Commands Cheatsheet

## 1. Navigate to your Git project folder

use `cd` to move between folders, for example 

```
cd workspce
cd bdl02 haidar_git_cheatsheet
```

## 2. check the status of the project

- `git status` to see changes added to the file, and if some files are ready to be committed. 
It gives me an overview of the project at that specific moment of time.

- `git log` 

- `git diff`
